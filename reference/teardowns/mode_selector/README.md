## Teardown Notes

The mode selectoris a small PCB mounted on the handlebars of the bike which has two functions:
- Select whether the bike is in no boost/medium boost/high boost
- Display the battery SOC% on the e-paper screen

The mode selector has 4 pins:
- GND
- 12V
- RS485 A
- RS485 B

The mode selector is 'waterproofed' with VHB tape. Prying gently at it after removing the screws will expose the innards.
